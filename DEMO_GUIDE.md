## **5-Minute Technical Deep Dive**

### **Frontend Assessment**
```javascript
// Test these React.js capabilities:
1. Component-based architecture
2. State management with hooks
3. Responsive CSS implementation
4. Dynamic content rendering
5. Form handling and validation
```

**What to Examine:**
- Inspect the clean, semantic HTML structure
- Notice CSS Grid/Flexbox responsive layout
- Observe React DevTools (if installed) showing component hierarchy
- Test form validation and error handling

### **Backend API Testing**
```bash
# Direct API endpoint testing:
GET  https://admuseeasy-production-8a59.up.railway.app/api/health
GET  https://admuseeasy-production-8a59.up.railway.app/api/test

# Response format shows professional API design
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-XX-XX",
  "uptime": "XX hours",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### **Authentication System Evaluation**
1. **Demo Mode**: Test the seamless mock authentication
2. **OAuth Ready**: Notice Google OAuth integration (ready for production)
3. **JWT Implementation**: Observe secure token handling in browser storage
4. **Session Management**: Test logout/login flow persistence
