# Admuse Easy

A simple web application that helps users create personality-based advertising concepts using mascot characters (Capybara, Hamster, Parrot). Each mascot has a distinct copywriting style to create headlines, taglines, and calls-to-action that align with the brand's mood.

## Features
- Simple UI for product info, mascot/mood selection, and ad generation
- Mascot logic for creative, personality-driven ad copy
- Multi-platform output: Billboard, Instagram Reel, Landing Page
- Ready for AI integration (Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI)

## Why AI?
AI powers the mascot logic and is designed to generate creative, brand-consistent ad copy. The app is ready for integration with Azure OpenAI or Google Vertex AI for even smarter, product-specific copywriting and storytelling.

## How it Works
1. Users input product details and select a mascot/mood
2. The app uses mascot logic to generate ad layouts and copy
3. (Planned) AI integration will generate unique slogans and stories for each product and mascot

## Tech Stack
- React (frontend)
- Node.js/Express (backend, ready for AI integration)
- GitHub (repo & CI/CD)
- (Optional: Azure OpenAI or Google Vertex AI for future AI features)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/nuwnian/AdmuseEasy.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   - Frontend: `cd client && npm install`
   - Backend: `cd ../server && npm install`
3. Run the app:
   - Backend: `node index.js` (from `server` folder)
   - Frontend: `npm start` (from `client` folder)
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app
