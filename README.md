# Admuse Easy

Admuse Easy is a web app that empowers anyone—no coding required—to create emotionally resonant ads using mascot personalities and mood-driven design. Just enter your product info, pick a mascot, and Admuse Easy generates ad layouts and copy for billboards, Instagram, or landing pages.

## Features
- Simple UI for product info, mascot/mood selection, and ad generation
- Mascot logic for creative, personality-driven ad copy
- Multi-platform output: Billboard, Instagram Reel, Landing Page
- Ready for AI integration (Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI)

## Why AI?
AI powers the mascot logic and is designed to generate creative, brand-consistent ad copy. The app is ready for integration with Azure OpenAI or Google Vertex AI for even smarter, product-specific copywriting and storytelling.

## How it Works
1. Users input product details and select a mascot/mood
2. The app uses mascot logic to generate ad layouts and copy
3. (Planned) AI integration will generate unique slogans and stories for each product and mascot
