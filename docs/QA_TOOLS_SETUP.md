# QA Tools Setup Guide

## Overview
Your AdmuseEasy app now has comprehensive monitoring and analytics setup with industry-standard tools. Here's what we've implemented:

## üö® Error Tracking - Sentry

### What it does:
- **Real-time error monitoring** - Get notified immediately when users encounter errors
- **Performance monitoring** - Track slow API calls and page loads
- **User context** - See exactly what users were doing when errors occurred
- **Release tracking** - Compare error rates between deployments

### Setup Required:
1. **Create free Sentry account**: https://sentry.io
2. **Create new project** for your app
3. **Copy your DSN** from Project Settings ‚Üí Client Keys
4. **Update environment variables**:
   - Server: `SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here` in `server/.env`
   - Client: `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=your-dsn-here` in `client/.env`
   - Railway: Add these same variables in your Railway dashboard

### What errors get tracked:
- ‚úÖ API failures (Google Gemini, MongoDB connection)
- ‚úÖ Authentication errors
- ‚úÖ React component crashes
- ‚úÖ Network timeouts
- ‚úÖ JavaScript exceptions
- ‚ùå Development-only errors (filtered out)
- ‚ùå 404 navigation errors (too noisy)

## üìä User Analytics - Google Analytics 4

### What it tracks:
- **Page views** - Which pages users visit most
- **Ad generations** - Conversion tracking for each mascot choice
- **User interactions** - Button clicks, navigation patterns
- **Authentication flow** - Login/signup success rates
- **User retention** - How often users return

### Setup Required:
1. **Create Google Analytics account**: https://analytics.google.com
2. **Create new GA4 property** for your website
3. **Copy your Measurement ID** (starts with G-)
4. **Update environment variable**:
   - Client: `REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX` in `client/.env`
   - Railway: Add this variable in your Railway dashboard

### Events tracked:
- `generate_ad` - When users successfully create ads
- `nav_click` - Navigation pattern analysis
- `user_interaction` - Button clicks and form submissions
- `authentication` - Login/signup tracking

## üè• Health Monitoring

### Server Health Check:
- Endpoint: `/api/health`
- Returns: Server status and database connectivity
- Use for uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, etc.)

### Performance Metrics:
- API response times tracked by Sentry
- Page load speeds tracked by GA4
- Error rates and success rates for all features

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Railway Environment Variables:
Add these to your Railway dashboard:

```
# Sentry (Error Tracking)
SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-from-step-above
SENTRY_RELEASE=1.0.0

# Google Analytics (User Tracking)
REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn-from-step-above
REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID=your-ga4-tracking-id
REACT_APP_SENTRY_RELEASE=1.0.0
```

### What you'll see in production:
1. **Sentry Dashboard**: Real-time errors, performance issues, user feedback
2. **Google Analytics**: User behavior, conversion funnels, traffic sources
3. **Railway Logs**: Server status and deployment health

## üìà Key Metrics to Monitor

### Business Metrics (Google Analytics):
- **Ad Generation Rate**: How many users create ads
- **Mascot Popularity**: Which mascots are most popular
- **User Retention**: Daily/weekly active users
- **Conversion Funnel**: Signup ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Ad Creation

### Technical Metrics (Sentry):
- **Error Rate**: < 1% is good, > 5% needs attention
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms is good, > 2s is problematic
- **Page Load Time**: < 3s is good, > 5s loses users
- **Crash-Free Sessions**: Should be > 99%

## üîß Additional QA Tools (Optional)

### 1. Uptime Monitoring
- **UptimeRobot** (free): Ping your `/api/health` endpoint every 5 minutes
- **Pingdom** (paid): More detailed monitoring with global locations

### 2. Performance Testing
- **GTmetrix**: Test page load speeds
- **PageSpeed Insights**: Google's performance analysis

### 3. Security Monitoring
- **Snyk**: Scan for dependency vulnerabilities
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security testing for web apps

### 4. User Feedback
- **Hotjar**: User session recordings and heatmaps
- **Intercom**: Customer support chat

## ‚úÖ Benefits You'll Get

### Immediate Value:
- **Know when things break** before users complain
- **See what users actually do** on your site
- **Track business metrics** like conversion rates
- **Debug issues faster** with error context

### Long-term Value:
- **Data-driven decisions** about new features
- **Performance optimization** based on real metrics
- **User experience improvements** from behavior data
- **Professional monitoring** for potential investors/clients
