# AdmuseEasy Bug Tracking Setup

## 🚨 Issues to Track with QA Tools:

### Current Problems:
1. **Site Unreachable**: Intermittent connectivity issues
2. **Google OAuth Failures**: Authentication not working consistently
3. **Server Startup Errors**: Sentry configuration issues
4. **Deployment Issues**: Railway connectivity problems

### QA Tools Solution:

#### 1. Sentry Setup (Error Tracking)
- Get DSN from https://sentry.io (free account)
- Add to Railway environment variables
- Track OAuth failures and server errors

#### 2. Uptime Monitoring
- Use UptimeRobot (free) to ping /api/health every 5 minutes
- Get alerts when site goes down

#### 3. Google Analytics
- Track user behavior during OAuth failures
- See where users drop off in the auth flow

## 🎯 Benefits for Your Issues:

### Before QA Tools:
❌ Site down → You don't know until you check manually
❌ OAuth fails → Users frustrated, no error logs
❌ Deployment issues → Trial and error debugging

### With QA Tools:
✅ **Real-time alerts** when site goes down
✅ **Error context** showing exactly why OAuth fails
✅ **Performance tracking** of API response times
✅ **User behavior data** during failures

## 📊 What You'll See:

1. **Sentry Dashboard**: "OAuth error: Invalid redirect_uri at 10:23 PM"
2. **UptimeRobot Alert**: "Site down for 3 minutes starting 10:20 PM"
3. **Analytics**: "50% of users abandon during Google login"

This gives you **data-driven debugging** instead of guessing!
